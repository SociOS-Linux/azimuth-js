# `transact`

Functions for signing and sending transactions.

#### `async signTransaction(tx)`

`tx` is a transaction object, as generated by the contract action functions.
If `tx.gas` is undefined, it will be estimated. If `tx.gasPrice` is undefined,
a default is used. If `tx.nonce` is undefined, Web3 retrieves the next nonce.
If `tx.chainId` is undefined, Web3 fills it in.
Note that Web3 cannot fill in most of those blanks when not connected to a
functioning node (ie "offline mode"), so those will have to be filled in by the
UI or user prior to signing.

Returns a signed transaction object, with a `messageHash`, `v`, `r`, `s`, and `rawTransaction`

#### `async sendTransaction(signedTx)`

`signedTx` is either an object as returned by `signTransaction()`, or a `rawTransaction` hex string.

Returns Web3's Promise directly, which means its "PromiEvent" can be used to
wait for receipt, confirmation, etc. See also
[this](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth.html#eth-sendtransaction-return)
and the other parts of the documentation it refers to.
